Investigating the Effectiveness of D-Penicillamine for Cirrhosis Treatment : A Propensity Score Matching 
Analysis

o Examined the impact of D-penicillamine, a potential treatment for cirrhosis, using a robust statistical 
approach. We analyzed data from 312 patients with cirrhosis to assess the drug's effectiveness. 
o Using Logistic regression, estimated propensity scores and Matching is done between treatment 
and control group using K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) 
o By comparing the matched groups, we calculated the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), which 
represents the average difference in cirrhosis outcomes between patients who received D- 
penicillamine and those who didn't. This analysis provided valuable insights into the drug's 
effectiveness in treating cirrhosis.
